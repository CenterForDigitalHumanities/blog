We are very excited in the CDH@SLU that Debra Cashion will presenting the Broken Books application at the [Schoenberg Symposium](http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/lectures/ljs_symposium8.html) this week. As a last minute treat, Lisa Fagin Davis, Executive Director of the Medieval Academy of America, jumped on board and has put her work into Broken Books giving us another excellent use case and demonstration of Broken Books.
